# Vanilla Javascript "The Elm Architecture" TODO

[DEMO](https://jsbin.com/xidavutofo/edit?html,js,output)

This is the simplest possible implementation gathered from multiple resources.

It avoids the cumbersomeness of using functional programming while being easier to reason about and having the same benefits.

The project uses two dev dependencies:
- Virtual-DOM, essential for the rendering process).
- Webpack, make the code usable in a browser.


```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm i

# Build the bundle file
npm run build
```
